/** An abstract field structure. Addition associates and commutes, and
  * multiplication associates, commutes, and distributes over addition.
  * Addition and multiplication both have an identity element, every element
  * has an additive inverse, and every element except zero has a multiplicative
  * inverse. To the extent practicable, the following axioms should hold.
  * 
  * '''Axioms for addition''':
  *   - if 𝑎 and 𝑏 are elements in `this`, then their sum 𝑎 + 𝑏 is also an element in `this`.
  *   - 𝑎 + 𝑏 == 𝑏 + 𝑎 for all elements 𝑎, 𝑏 in `this`.
  *   - (𝑎 + 𝑏) + 𝑐 == 𝑎 + (𝑏 + 𝑐) for all elements 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 in `this`.
  *   - `this` has an element `zero` such that `zero` + 𝑎 == 𝑎 for every element 𝑎 in `this`.
  *   - to every element 𝑎 in `this` corresponds an element -𝑎 in `this` such that 𝑎 + (-𝑎) == `zero`.
  * 
  * '''Axioms for multiplication''':
  *   - if 𝑎 and 𝑏 are elements in `this`, then their product 𝑎 * 𝑏 is also an element in `this`.
  *   - 𝑎 * 𝑏 == 𝑏 * 𝑎 for all 𝑎, 𝑏 elements in `this`.
  *   - (𝑎 * 𝑏) * 𝑐 == 𝑎 * (𝑏 * 𝑐) for all elements 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 in `this`.
  *   - `this` has an element `unit` != `zero` such that `unit` * 𝑎 == 𝑎 for every element 𝑎 in `this`.
  *   - if 𝑎 is in `this` and 𝑎 != `zero` then there exists an element 𝑎.`inverse` such that 𝑎 * 𝑎.`inverse` == `unit`.
  * 
  * '''The distributive law''':
  *   - 𝑎 * (𝑏 + 𝑐) == (𝑎 * 𝑏) + (𝑎 * 𝑐) for all elements 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 in `this`.
